This repository contains code examples that demonstrate how to use the AWS SDKs to interact with AWS services.

To invoke this example code, you must have an AWS account. For more information about creating an account, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

You must also have AWS credentials configured. For steps on using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to configure credentials, see [CLI Configuration basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
