# Creating an IAM User (StudentUser01)
Log in to the AWS Management Console as the **root** user.

We don't use the root user (bad practice)

We need a user who should have 
- right builtin policies to access EC2 machines
- right custom policy to access Kubernetes services
- right custom policy to start a load balancer 

**Steps**
- Go to IAM service (Identity and Access Management).
- Select Users and click Add user.
- Enter the username as 'TestUser_0xâ€™.
- Select Programmatic access to enable the generation of an Access key ID and Secret access key.
- Proceed to permissions.

**Assigning Policies**
- Under the permissions section, assign both built-in and custom policies:
a. Built-in Policies: Choose following relevant built-in policies:
	- AmazonEC2FullAccess
	- AmazonS3FullAccess
b. Custom Policies: Write the JSON of following policy:
- Select *Add Permissions > Create Customer Managed Policy* to attach new permissions, open the *JSON* editor and paste in the below example policy:
Policy Name: **Full-Access-to-EKS-For-StudentUser01**
```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": "eks:*",
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}
```
):
- Select *Add Permissions > Create Customer Managed Policy* to attach new permissions, open the *JSON* editor and paste in the below example policy:
Policy Name: **Sufficient-treasure-access-For-StudentUser01**
```

## Pert 2: Django Application in VSCode

To get started with the code examples, ensure you have VSCode, Python installed on Ubuntu

## ---------------Install VSCode ----------------
VS Code
Go to 'Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts'

Set the 'Terminal: Copy Selection' keybindings to Ctrl-C.

Set the 'Terminal: Paste into Active Terminal' keybinding to Ctrl-V.

sudo systemctl restart gdm3

## ---------------DJango App-------------------
**Step 1: APP Start Commands**
Create an Empty Folder: StudentUser90_App
```
python -m venv .venv
```
```
ls -a
```
activate the environment
```
. .venv/bin/activate
```
```
pip install django
```
```
django-admin startproject student_project
cd student_project
```
```
python manage.py startapp studentApp
```
In student_project/settings.py>> 'studentApp' to the INSTALLED_APPS  

**Step 2: Define the Student Model**
1. In students/models.py>> 
```
from django.db import models

class Student(models.Model):
       first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
       last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
       age = models.IntegerField()

       def __str__(self):
           return f"{self.first_name} {self.last_name}
```
2. Create SQLLITE Database Tables by migration commands:
```
python manage.py makemigrations studentApp
python manage.py migrate
```
4. Run the server for now:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

----------Adding forms Student List and Add --------
**Step 3: Create a Form for the Student Model**
1. In studentApp/forms.py (create this file if it doesn't exist):
```
from django import forms
from .models import Student

class StudentForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Student
        fields = ['first_name', 'last_name', 'age']

```
**Step 4: Create a View to Handle the Form**
In students/views.py:
```
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import StudentForm
from .models import Student

def student_add_view(request):
       if request.method == 'POST':
           form = StudentForm(request.POST)
           if form.is_valid():
               form.save()
               return redirect('student_success')
       else:
           form = StudentForm()
       return render(request, 'students/student_add.html', {'form': form})

def student_add_success_view (request):
    return render(request, 'students/student_add_success.html')

def student_list_view(request):
    students = Student.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'students/student_list.html', {'students': students})
```
----
**Step 5: Create Templates for the Form**
1. Inside your students app directory, create a new folder named templates. Inside this, create another folder named students (to organize templates related to the students app).
2. Create  students/templates/students/student_add.html:
```
<h2>Enter Student Details</h2>
<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
3. Create students/student_add_success.html:
```
<h2>Student has been added successfully!</h2>
```
4. Create the Template for listing students in `students/templates/students/student_list.html`:
```
   <h2>Student List</h2>
<table>
    <tr><th>First Name</th><th>Last Name</th><th>Age</th><th>Actions</th></tr>
    {% for student in students %}
    <tr>
        <td>{{ student.first_name }}</td>
        <td>{{ student.last_name }}</td>
        <td>{{ student.age }}</td>
   
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
</table>
<a href="{% url 'student_add' %}">Add New Student</a>
```

----
Step 9: Configure URLs
1. In students/urls.py (create this file if it doesn't exist):
```
from django.urls import path
from .views import student_add_view, student_add_success_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('add/', student_add_view, name='student_add'),
    path('success/', student_add_success_view, name='student_success'),
]
```
2. Include the students URLs in the main urls.py of student_project:
```
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
path('students/', include('studentApp.urls')),
]
```
3. Update the URLs in `students/urls.py`:
```
from .views import student_list_view

urlpatterns = [
path('add/', student_add_view, name='student_add'),
path('success/', student_add_success_view, name='student_success'),
path('list/', student_list_view, name='student_list'),
]
```
